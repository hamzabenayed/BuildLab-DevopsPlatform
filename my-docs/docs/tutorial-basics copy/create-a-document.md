# Configure the Right Build for Your Project


## Step 2. Configure the Right Build for Your Project

To configure the right build for your project in Build Lab, you'll need to follow a few key steps to ensure that your app is built and deployed correctly.

Firstly, you'll need to select the operating system of your mobile application. This will determine which platform your app is built for and ensure that it works correctly on the selected platform.

Next, it's important to validate the unit tests. This step ensures that any code changes made to your app are properly tested before the build starts. This helps to catch any issues or bugs early on in the process, before they become bigger problems.

After that, you'll need to upload your keystore file to sign your app. This is an important step for both security and functionality. Signing your app with a keystore file ensures that it can be installed and run on devices without any issues, and also helps to prevent unauthorized modifications to your app.

If you're planning to upload your app to the Google Play Store, you'll also need to upload your credential file and add the necessary information. This includes things like the app name, description, and screenshots. Make sure to select the right configuration to build your mobile app, based on the platform you're building for and the specific requirements of your app.

Overall, configuring the right build for your project is an essential step in the app development process. With Build Lab, you can easily configure your build and deploy your app with confidence, knowing that it's been properly tested and signed for security and functionality
